MS in Computer Science and Engineering Courses assignments and exams. The Code comments and project report will be explanatory. If in case you have a doubt or you find a mistake please let me know.

Project 1: Probability Distributions and Bayesian Networks
           The aim of the project is to construct a Bayesian network which results in a higher loglikelihood using the correlation between variables.

Project 2: Learning to Rank using Linear Regression
           The goal of this project is to use machine learning to solve a problem that arises in Information Retrieval,
one known as the Learning to Rank (LeToR) problem.

Project 3: Classification

Project 4: Introduction to Deep Learning
          In the previous assignment we learnt how to implement a Convolutional Neural Network on MNIST images. In this project we extend our understanding of CNN and implement a model for classifying CelebA data set to determine whether the person in a portrait image is wearing eyeglasses or not. The task here is to tune hyperparameters and apply regularization to improve performance.
