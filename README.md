MS in Computer Science and Engineering Courses assignments and exams. The Code comments and project report will be explanatory. If in case you have a doubt or you find a mistake please let me know.

Project 1: Probability Distributions and Bayesian Networks
           The aim of the project is to construct a Bayesian network which results in a higher loglikelihood using the correlation between variables.

Project 2: Learning to Rank using Linear Regression
           The goal of this project is to use machine learning to solve a problem that arises in Information Retrieval,
one known as the Learning to Rank (LeToR) problem.

Project 3: Classification
